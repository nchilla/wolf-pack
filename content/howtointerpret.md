The graph shows the frequency in which the search term appeared over the time span. To adjust for the different size and scopes of publications, frequency is calculated as the number of times a term appeared a month as a percentage of all terms of the same word length in the coverage that month. 

The graph can be used to show trends, over months and years, in usage of the terms you've searched for, and compare these trends across media sources.
