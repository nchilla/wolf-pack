The search bar has three fields: mentions, publications and time span. You can add multiple parameters to each of these using the (+) button. 

#### Mentions

Enter a sequence of up to 4 words, for example: “gangs”, “youth violence”, “police reports”, “inner city crime”. You can also search for names of people and places, law and policies, neighborhoods and cities. Using the (+) button, you may also search for more than one term at a time, to see a comparative view of how several terms were used over time.  

The database maintains the exact text from the original news stories. This means that data was not preprocessed or ‘cleaned’ to remove common words (sometimes called ‘stop words’ in technical parlance). The database is case-sensitive. As the goal of this interface is to support an in-depth, historical understanding of the use of language in reporting on crime, we chose not to preprocess the data. This means that the results you'll see for ‘crime victims’ and ‘victims of crime’, for example, would be different. In your research, you may want to run several permutations of your search queries to cover these different expressions. 

#### Publications

Choose a specific publication from the drop-down menu, an aggregate of all print or broadcast (TV and radio) news, or all publications in the database. 

The publications available to search were chosen as influential national, regional and local news outlets from the 70s through the end of the century. We included both general audience outlets and newspapers from the Black press. From each publication, we collected all stories in which the word ‘crime’ appeared at least once, as a blunt tool to filter stories. 

We pulled the news stories from the LexisNexis database. Note that some of the publications  were not fully digitized and only had data for parts of the time span. Where there is no data, the graph line breaks.

#### Time span

You can search for the entire time span of the database, 1975-2000, or parts of this time span, for example 1990-1995.
