# Terminal set-up

1. Run `npm install` to install node dependencies

2. Download database file `all-pubs-eav.db` from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ctekr4xd5nlhxpu/all-pubs-eav.db?dl=0) and put it in `data/`.

3. Run `npm run dev`. This will run sveltekit, starting a local server for the project

4. Navigate to `localhost:5173` (or whatever server the terminal leads you to) to test out the graph. Youâ€™ll see search requests and performance details in the terminal, as well as in the browser console.
